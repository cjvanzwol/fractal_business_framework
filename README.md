# Fractal Business Framework
Idea for combining different business perspectives

**Making business choices that work. Software development analogy for real life: Like software is only usefully when it works, when it does what is is supposed to do.** 
The framework should be Fractal, so every perspective can be used in smaller and bigger scopes, and in sync with the bigger and smaller scopes it is part of. Analogy: the Artichoke
